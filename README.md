Stupid slide presentation software using Perl and SDL.

I was threatening if forced to stop using my other slide software (which
Awwaiid created and I fixed up, at http://slowass.net/~scott/pres.html) 
that I'd write presentation softwre that did the old school graphic
demo "sinus scroller" effect (see youtube for examples).  They did
and so I did and here it is.  I also added a Unicorn function ('u'
key that draws glittering animated unicorns), a function to automatically
search Google for images and pick a random one given a keyword, 
software defined transition effects, and other stupidity.  Share
and enjoy.
